# ant-repellent
Finding the repellent effectiveness of different substances on ants using CV and Raspberry Pi 

I placed ants in a glass tank with food (banana) in the center and different substances (e.g. cinnamon, mint, etc.) surrounding it. I used a Raspberry Pi to take images in 1-minute intervals of the ants over 40 minutes. Using computer visualization with Python (through changes in pixel values) I counted the number of ants in each image taken by the Raspberry Pi for each substance. I made density graphs and line graphs over time to visualize the repellent power of each substance to determine what substance was most repellent.
